A parallel program that uses multi-\/threading to divide computations among threads.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A parallel program that uses multi-\/threading to divide computations among threads. 

This is achieved using the Open\+MP library. Open\+MP is a library for parallel programming that shares memory and data between threads It makes it much easier and simpler to create multi-\/threaded software, which can be achieved by using a pragma. A pragma is a compiler directive, which allows you to send additional instructions to the compiler on run time.
